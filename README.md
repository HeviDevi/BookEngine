## BookEngine

# Description
BookEngine is a web application designed to help users search for and save their favorite books. The motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly platform that allows book enthusiasts to easily find and manage their reading lists.  Through this project, we learned about integrating third-party APIs, managing state in a web application, and implementing user authentication.
